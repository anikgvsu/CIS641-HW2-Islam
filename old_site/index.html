        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            As a Generalist Software Engineer with 5 years of experience in full-stack development, I specialize in Java and Python and have a strong interest in machine learning, particularly in generative deep learning models for natural language processing and sentiment analysis. I am currently building a pipeline to generate training data for a generative deep learning model to be used by an upstander bot. Additionally, I have built the Birth & Death Registration System of Bangladesh, the country's most widely used online registration system.
